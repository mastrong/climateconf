    <p class="desc">
      We strongly recommend booking early, as Bologna remains busy with trade fairs and cultural events through autumn.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
      While lodging is available near the data centre in northern Bologna, most visitors choose to stay in the city centre.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>City Centre (recommended):</b> walkable, lively, excellent dining.</li>
      <li><b>Near the Data Centre:</b> quiet and convenient for daily sessions.</li>
      <li><b>Avoid:</b> Via Zamboni / Piazza Verdi (university zone) and the train-station/Montagnola area due to noise.</li>
