      We invite proposals that engage with data visualization as a driver of understanding, engagement, and meaningful action in the face of climate and environmental crises. Contributions may explore how complex information is transformed into compelling visual narratives that resonate with diverse audiences, including policymakers, researchers, and frontline communities.
    </p>

    <p class="desc">
      Proposals may include tools, methods, or case studies that illustrate interdisciplinary collaboration, co-design, or the creation of scientific, journalistic, artistic, and creative visualizations.
